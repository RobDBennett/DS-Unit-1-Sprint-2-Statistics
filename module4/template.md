# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.

### Note to instructor- I will probably work on Idea1.
# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?

Philosophy, videogames, table-top RPGs, LARPing, the Theory of Mind, evolutionary biology, machine learning (at least the concept of it; I'm still learning)->AI.

What do you know about?

I know about games, LARPing, a lot of esoteric philosophy, game theory

What decisions do you face?

This question lacks context. 

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? For example 1, I am going to focus on RPGs/Videogames

1. Geographic Variation
I'm sure I could find data about where in the US more games of what type are sold in what region. However, I expect these to generally reflect population distributions.

2. Trend related to the news
It's possible that the covid pandemic is affecting the sales of video-games. I predict that it would have a spike when stay-in orders were first issued, and tapering off as fluid money started to drop off.

3. Who does that?
I know that a wide demographic of people purchase and play videogames, so I would expect this to be a population distribution, but I could probably compare major cities/locations to populations of that area to find percentages?

4. Answering a question people care about
An interesting question that I have about this is how many people are like me: Impulse buying a cool new game and then playing it for... a very brief time and then never playing it again.

5. Valuable to businesses
Possibly? I'm sure that demographic breakdowns might be interesting to marketing tactics. The same might be said for how long a person plays a game. Or maybe I could find the price of a game and compare it to the length of time you play and compare that to general adverstising.

6. What's the most popular?
Oh yeah, which title is the most popular, or which has the longest playtime, or which has the highest advertising. There's got to be data about that somewhere.

7. Cost/Money rankings
Comparing the price of a game to the instances of purchase, or length of play?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
I believe that most older folks assume that videogames or games in general are a 'young person' thing, but most of my friends are in their late 30's and are absurdly active on videogames. I think there is also some common misconceptions about how people spend their time.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
In the above examples, if I could find data about how long people play a new videogame, that would be very cool. However, the price of a title vs the number of sales is also pretty interesting to me.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Well, if I can find data about the most popular sold titles and prices, I could compare them. Or I could compare the types of games with frequency sold.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Videogames is pretty rich, so yes? 

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Well, probably. If I was to move away from videogames, I'm sure I could find data for purchase of a different item and the use of that item (like kitchen equipment? crafting tools?). I dunno, there's got to be a purchase/useage comparison on some things?

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
Kaggle, UC Irvine, anicdotal surveys.

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

Philosophy, videogames, table-top RPGs, LARPing, the Theory of Mind, evolutionary biology, machine learning (at least the concept of it; I'm still learning)->AI.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? I will focus on Philosophy for this one. 

1. Geographic Variation
This topic is a bit more cerebral, so its harder to bound. However, if I could find university data sets, I might be able to compare the frequency of philosophy majors in a given university and compare them to different universities / large population areas.

2. Trend related to the news
I'd be curious to see how the pandemic has affected people's philosophies, but I'm not sure how to capture that data.

3. Who does that?
Literally everyone has a philosophy about life, but most don't engage it deeply. This is a topic that has shallow, widespread appeal, and very little deep appeal.

4. Answering a question people care about
Philosophy is all about questions that people care about. I suppose it would be interesting to compare a specific question, like 'how do we define thought', and it be curious to compare how different schools of philosophy view that.

5. Valuable to businesses
This one is really hard to put an economic value on.

6. What's the most popular?
This seems like a thing that might have data out there. Like, how do people commonly identify? Or who is their favorite philosopher (and which school do they hail from)?

7. Cost/Money rankings
Maybe the cost of universities?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
People presume that philosophy isn't a commonly used topic, but most people think about philosophy in some way over the course of their lives.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
While I think it would be really interesting to see how modern people identify philosophically, I'm not sure there'd be any data for this one. Like, "do most people identify as existentialists?"

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Sure, open ended question here. Like what is the best philosophy? Or do people's identification change with where they are (like regions)

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Philosophy has a lot of questions, its most about has anyone asked and collected this data? 

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Probably.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
Kaggle? UC Irvine? Google might have some educational institutions datasets.
